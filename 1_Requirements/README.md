## Defining Our System
Automated teller machines (ATMs) are electronic banking outlets that allow people to complete transactions without going into a branch of their bank.
Some ATMs are simple cash dispensers while others allow a variety of transactions such as check deposits, balance transfers, and bill payments.
The first ATMs appeared in the mid- to late-1960s and have grown in number to over 2 million worldwide.
